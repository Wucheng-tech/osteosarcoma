Title: Single-cell transcriptome sequencing reveals chemotherapy-induced changes in malignant and immune subsets in osteosarcoma

R package: Seurat, inferCNV, Monocle, CellChat

Seurat was used to analyze single-cell data, including integration, clustering, differential analysis, etc; 
copykat was used to estimate CNV; 
Monocle was used to perform pseudo-time; 
CellChat was used to infer the RB cell-cell communications and significant pathways.
